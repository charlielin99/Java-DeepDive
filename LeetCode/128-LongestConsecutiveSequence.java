We will use HashMap. The key thing is to keep track of the sequence length and store that in the boundary points of the sequence. For example, as a result, for sequence {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, map.get(1) and map.get(5) should both return 5.

Whenever a new element n is inserted into the map, do two things:

See if n - 1 and n + 1 exist in the map, and if so, it means there is an existing sequence next to n. Variables left and right will be the length of those two sequences, while 0 means there is no sequence and n will be the boundary point later. Store (left + right + 1) as the associated value to key n into the map.
Use left and right to locate the other end of the sequences to the left and right of n respectively, and replace the value with the new length.

Everything inside the for loop is O(1) so the total time is O(n).
