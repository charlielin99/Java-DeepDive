    This problem is essentially let us to find whether there are several numbers in a set which are able to sum to a specific value (in this problem, the value is sum/2).

Actually, this is a 0/1 knapsack problem, for each number, we can pick it or not. Let us assume dp[i][j] means whether the specific sum j can be gotten from the first i numbers. If we can pick such a series of numbers from 0-i whose sum is j, dp[i][j] is true, otherwise it is false.

Base case: dp[0][0] is true; (zero number consists of sum 0 is true)

Transition function: For each number, if we don't pick it, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j], which means if the first i-1 elements has made it to j, dp[i][j] would also make it to j (we can just ignore nums[i]). If we pick nums[i]. dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-nums[i]], which represents that j is composed of the current value nums[i] and the remaining composed of other previous numbers. Thus, the transition function is dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] || dp[i-1][j-nums[i]]
