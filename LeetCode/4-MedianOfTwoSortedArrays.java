class Solution {
/*do binary search. suppose the shorter list is A with length n. the runtime is O(log(n)) which means no matter how large B array is, it only depends on the size of A. It makes sense because if A has only one element while B has 100 elements, the median must be one of A[0], B[49], and B[50] without check everything else. If A[0] <= B[49], B[49] is the answer; if B[49] < A[0] <= B[50], A[0] is the answer; else, B[50] is the answer.

After binary search, we get the approximate location of median. Now we just need to compare at most 4 elements to find the answer. This step is O(1).

the same solution can be applied to find kth element of 2 sorted arrays.
